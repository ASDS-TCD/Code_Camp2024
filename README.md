# 2024 ASDS Coding Camp
Lecture handouts and script files for the ASDS code camp at TCD.\
Special thanks to Dr. Martyn Egan for his input and course materials.


The *Coding Camp* is designed to give you training in three main areas: R basics, Python basics, and developing an effective computational workflow.

At the end of camp, students will be able to:

- Start the semester excited and ready to learn new methods :smile:
- Understand basic Data Science workflows and good work practices
- Import libraries, download and merge datasets, and apply functions
- Make simple graphs in ggplot2
- Write professional documents using RMarkdown and LaTeX

This repository contains all lecture handouts and script/markdown files from classes.\
Files are divided into two folders: code contains code files, documentation contains handouts.\
You can download this material and work through it yourself. All scripts are commented.\
The file names correspond to the weekday they were used, note that on Tuesday we used the R script only.

**Note**: To download *all* files in a zip, click on the green "code" button on this page and then "download zip".
